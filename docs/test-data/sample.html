    <h1>Read4You Test Document</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This is a test document for the Read4You Chrome extension. It contains multiple paragraphs 
        and sentences that can be used to verify the text-to-speech functionality, sentence highlighting, 
        and navigation controls.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Accessibility Features</h2>
    <p>
        The Read4You extension is designed to help people with weak vision access web content more easily. 
        Users can select any text on a webpage and have it read aloud using Google's text-to-speech API.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The extension provides several useful features. First, it highlights each sentence as it is being read. 
        Second, it allows users to pause and resume playback at any time. Third, users can navigate between 
        sentences using next and previous buttons.
    </p>
    
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        When you select text on any webpage, you can right-click to open the context menu. Choose "Play selected text" 
        to start the text-to-speech playback. Alternatively, you can open the side panel and click the Play button 
        after selecting text.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Note:</strong> This document contains exactly five paragraphs with multiple sentences in each. 
        This structure is ideal for testing sentence-by-sentence navigation and highlighting functionality.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Testing Scenarios</h2>
    <p>
        This test document supports various testing scenarios. You can test single paragraph selection, 
        multiple paragraph selection, or entire page reading. The consistent structure makes it easy to 
        verify that the extension correctly splits text into sentences and maintains proper synchronization 
        between audio playback and visual highlighting.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The extension also handles special cases well. It correctly processes abbreviations like Dr. and Mr. 
        It handles numbers such as 123 and 456.78 appropriately. Even URLs like https://example.com are 
        managed correctly. All of these elements are important for a robust text-to-speech implementation.
